# GameDeveloper Test for IdiomaPlus
A simple RPG made for the tecnical test for IdiomaPlus's GameDeveloper position. 

The main menu background might not be pretty, some parts of the code could use refactoring and are not 100% what I find as quality code.
As most games its a struggle to decide what to polish and what to leave as is. Decided mid-development to focus on achieving an 'ok' level of quality and focus on features (looking for a balance between convenience and performance). Still I find the code to follow good practices, while not being fully polished.

Base project given by IdiomaPlus: https://github.com/gersonip/IdiomaPlusDevTest

The test 'rules' can be found in the word document. The test asks for the development of an RPG with a number of features described in the document provided.
